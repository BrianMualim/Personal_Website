Hey everyone, allow me to introduce myself! My name is Brian Mualim (you can call me Bry for short), and I’m a **fourth-year student** studying at **University of California, Los Angeles**. I’m a **Statistics and Data Science** major with a Specialization in **Computer Science.**

I’m a result-driven data enthusiast who thrives on creating pipelines which collects, cleans, processes, and visualizes data in an efficient manner. My motto when working with data is: KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!)

Apart from my academics, I love keeping up with the NBA, as well as going to the gym. I’m also a huge history nerd and have a special place in my heart for topics relating to WW2 and the ancient Roman Empire!
