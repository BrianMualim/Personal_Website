    "text": "Hey everyone, allow me to introduce myself! My name is Brian Mualim (you can call me Bry for short), and I’m a fourth-year student studying at University of California, Los Angeles. I’m a Statistics and Data Science major with a Specialization in Computer Science.\nI’m a result-driven data enthusiast who thrives on creating pipelines which collects, cleans, processes, and visualizes data in an efficient manner. My motto when working with data is: KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!)\nApart from my academics, I love keeping up with the NBA, as well as going to the gym. I’m also a huge history nerd and have a special place in my heart for topics relating to WW2 and the ancient Roman Empire!"
